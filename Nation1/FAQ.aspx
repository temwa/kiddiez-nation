    <h4>Can I place a very large order?</h4>
    <p>We currently have no maximum restriction on order size - although all orders are delivered at our discretion.

Orders over a certain Rand value (currently R7,000 but subject to change without notice) do have restrictions in the delivery slots available. While we will always attempt to meet the reserved delivery slot, we cannot guarantee a large order delivery slot. We reserve the right to contact you to arrange for a mutually acceptable alternative time or a full refund on your order.</p>

    <h3>Booking the delivery</h3>    
    <h4>If you don't deliver to my area, is it possible that you might in the future?</h4>
    <p>We are always growing our delivery network and will be interested in delivering to you if at all possible. You are invited to suggest your area, whether you are a registered Online Shopper or not.</p>
    <h4>How do I book a delivery slot?</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you book a delivery slot before you start shopping - the slot will then be reserved for 3 hours to allow you to complete your shop and check out. <br /> Once you have captured a valid delivery address, there are 2 ways to book a delivery slot. On the right hand side of the screen there is a module which shows your selected delivery address and time - here click on 'Book or Change' to reserve a delivery slot. Alternatively you can go into My PnP and click on 'Delivery Details', here you can select your delivery address and then click on 'Book a Delivery Slot'. <br />You will then be shown a calendar with all the available slots (and their associated prices) for booking; simply click on your preferred slot (it will go green) and click on 'Book Delivery Slot' at the bottom of the page to confirm. Note that your confirmed delivery address and slot will always be on display on the right hand side of the page. Some slots may have already been fully booked and will be displayed as 'Full'.</p>
    <h4>How do I change my delivery address?</h4>
    <p>Once you have selected a delivery address it will be displayed in the delivery module on the right hand side of the page under 'Delivery address'. You can change it by clicking the 'Change' button below the address. You can also change your address by selecting your profile from the main menu and clicking on 'Delivery Details'. You will be able to add a new address or edit the existing address.</p>
    <h4>How much does delivery cost?</h4>
    <p>The delivery charges vary depending on the time slot chosen. Available delivery time slots are marked with the relevant delivery fee.</p>
    <h4>Why is there a delivery charge?</h4>
    <p>There is a lot of work involved in getting your order delivered to you. The time it takes, the technology involved, your Personal Shopper and the team we use to make it all possible means we have to charge a reasonable fee for this convenient service. We always strive to keep our costs as low as possible so we can give you the best value. We have also varied our delivery charges to ensure there are different pricing options for you, and also to help us offer a better and consistent service.</p>
    <h4>What hours are deliveries made?</h4>
    <p>We generally deliver Monday to Saturday from 12:00 to 00:00, but individual areas may be subject to different delivery times. The times available are clearly displayed during the slot booking process.</p>

    <h3>Making a Payment</h3>
    <h4>How do I checkout?</h4>
    <p>Once you are satisfied with your cart and are ready to checkout, you press checkout and then follow the directions on the page even if you are redirected to your bank's website.</p>
    <h4>Which payment types are accepted?</h4>
    <p>We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club credit cards. We also accept Debit Cards that carry a signature and CVV number on the back. You can also use any smart shopper cash to pay for your order in part or in full.</p>
    <h4>When will payment be taken for my order?</h4>
    <p>Payment is only taken on the day the order is actually processed and not the day the order is placed on the website. Order processing will normally occur on the day of or the day before delivery is due. With the exception of any substitute products provided due to stock being unavailable, and any variable weight products, the price paid will be based on the day when the product was successfully ordered (and confirmed through an email order confirmation). Substitute products , and any items purchased by indicating a required weight, will be priced based on the in-store price on the day the order is processed. Due to orders being placed in advance of delivery and any unforeseen stock availability impacts between order date and delivery date, there may be some discrepancy between the guide price indicated on the website (when the order was placed), and the final price charged.</p>
    <h4>How do I know my order has gone through?</h4>
    <p>After the final step in the checkout process you will receive an on-screen order confirmation which contains an Order Number (this is the reference you should use in any correspondence with us). You will also receive an order confirmation email which details all the products in your order and the associated delivery details.</p>
    <h4>What happens if my payment fails?</h4>
    <p>Occasionally banks will reject credit or debit/cheque card payments made through our website. This is usually due to incorrect information being submitted or insufficient funds being available, but can also be down to technical or other failures within the banking system. Unfortunately these issues are mostly beyond our control but we do our best to keep you informed should this happen - that is why it is important your contact details provided are accurate and kept up to date. In order to remain PCI compliant we are not allowed to take new credit or debit/cheque card information from you other than through the placement of a new order (where you capture the new payment information into the website yourself).</p>
    <h4>How do I get a receipt?</h4>
    <p>Once you have submitted your order a confirmation page will be displayed, which you can then print for your reference. In addition you will receive an email confirmation of your order. Both confirmations show a guide price only as we take payment on the day we process your order (either the day of, or the day before, your delivery). Your delivery will also be accompanied by a tax invoice - one for you to keep, and the other for you to sign and be returned to us.</p>
    <h4>Are prices in the store the same as online?</h4>
    <p>Online shopping prices are generally the same as in-store prices. Exceptions may occur with specific in-store only promotions that will not be available online. Note that the online prices will be the same as the fulfilment store from where the order is picked.</p>
